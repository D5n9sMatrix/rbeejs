        New in version 0.7.0.

        Request supports SSL Verification by default. However, it relies on the user making
        a request with the URL that has the hostname in it. If, however, the user needs to make
        a request with the IP address, they cannot actually verify a certificate against the
        hostname they want to request.

        To accommodate this very rare need, weâ€™ve added HostHeaderSSLAdapter. Example usage:
        :return:
