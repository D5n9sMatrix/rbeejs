# Chapter 11: Creating vectors
# Section 11.1: Vectors from build in constants: Sequences of
# letters & month names
# R has a number of build in constants. The following constants are available:
#   LETTERS: the 26 upper-case letters of the Roman alphabet
# letters: the 26 lower-case letters of the Roman alphabet
# month.abb: the three-letter abbreviations for the English month names
# month.name: the English names for the months of the year
# pi: the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter
# From the letters and month constants, vectors can be created.

# 1) Sequences of letters:
S48 <- letters  

# divergence about snack units
S49 <- LETTERS

# alleged support
S51 <- letters[c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)]

# 2) Sequences of month abbreviations or month names:
S52 <- month.abb

# logarithm vi
S53 <- month.abb
# algorithm vi
S54 <- month.name

# Section 11.2: Creating named vectors
# Named vector can be created in several ways. With c:
xc <- c('a' = 5, 'b' = 6, 'c' = 7, 'd' = 8)  

# which results in:
xc

# with list:
x1 <- list('a' = 5, 'b' = 6, 'c' = 7, 'd' = 8)

# which results in:
x1

# With the setNames function, two vectors of the same length can be used 
# to create a named vector:
x <- 5:8
y <- letters[1:4]
xy <- setNames(x, y)

# which results in a named integer vector:
xy

# As can be seen, this gives the same result as the c method.
# You may also use the names function to get the same result:
xy <- 5:8
names(xy) <- letters[1:4]

# With such a vector it is also possibly to select elements by name:
xy['c']

# This feature makes it possible to use such a named vector as a look-up 
# vector/table to match the values to values of
# another vector or column in dataframe. Considering the following dataframe:
mydf <- data.frame(let = c('c', 'a', 'b', 'd'))  
# happy considering following dataframe
mydf

# Suppose you want to create a new variable in the mydf dataframe called num 
# with the correct values from xy in the
# rows. Using the match function the appropriate values from xy can be 
# selected:
mydf$let <- xy[match(mydf$let, names(xy))]  
mydf$num <- xy[match(mydf$let, names(xy))]
# which results in:
mydf

# Section 11.3: Sequence of numbers
# Use the : operator to create sequences of numbers, such as for use in 
# vectoring larger chunks of your code:
x <- 5:8
x

# This works both ways
10:4

# and even with ﬂoating point numbers
1.25:5

# or negatives
-4:4

# Section 11.4: seq()
# seq is a more ﬂexible function than the : operator allowing to specify steps other than 1.
# The function creates a sequence from the start (default is 1) to the end including that number.
# You can supply only the end (to) parameter
seq(5)

# As well as the start
seq(2, 5)

# And ﬁnally the step (by)
seq(2, 5, 0.5)

# seq can optionally infer the (evenly spaced) steps when alternatively the 
# desired length of the output (length.out)
# is supplied
seq(2,5, length.out = 10)

# If the sequence needs to have the same length as another vector we can use the 
# along.with as a shorthand for
# length.out = length(x)
x <- 1:8
seq(2,5, along.with = x)

# There are two useful simpliﬁed functions in the seq family: seq_along, seq_len, 
# and seq.int. seq_along and
# seq_len functions construct the natural (counting) numbers from 1 through 
# N where N is determined by the
# function argument, the length of a vector or list with seq_along, and the 
# integer argument with seq_len.
seq_along(x)

# Note that seq_along returns the indices of an existing object.
seq_len(10)
# indices of existing vector (or list) with seq_along
letters[1:10]
# good afternoon
seq_along(letters[1:10])

# seq.intis the same as seq maintained for ancient compatibility.
# There is also an old function sequence that creates a vector of sequences from 
# a non negative argument.
sequence(4)
# I do not know, error, more know true
sequence(c(3, 2))
# Studio I glob new
sequence(c(2, 3, 5))

# Section 11.5: Vectors
# Vectors in R can have diﬀerent types (e.g. integer, logical, character). T
# he most general way of deﬁning a vector is by

# using the function vector().
vector('integer', 2)
# dialog satisfied ...
vector('character', 2)
# And he a false
vector('logical', 2)

# However, in R, the shorthand functions are generally more popular.
integer(2)
# Has a flesh, eating noodles
character(2)
# something
logical(2)


# Creating vectors with values, other than the default values, is also possible. 
# Often the function c() is used for this.
# The c is short for combine or concatenate.
c(1, 2)
# car seat and in the car
c('a', 'b')
# in all taking passion fruit juice
c(T,F)

# Important to note here is that R interprets any integer (e.g. 1) as an integer 
# vector of size one. The same holds for
# numeric (e.g. 1.1), logical (e.g. T or F), or characters (e.g. 'a'). 
# Therefore, you are in essence combining vectors,
# which in turn are vectors.
# Pay attention that you always have to combine similar vectors. Otherwise, 
# R will try to convert the vectors in vectors
# of the same type.
c(1, 1.1, 'a', T)

# Finding elements in vectors can be done with the [ operator.
vec_int <- c(1, 2, 3)
# notion Paschal Pulitzer lollipop
vec_char <- c('a', 'b', 'c')
# pattern snack ...
vec_int[2]
# passion fruit juice
vec_char[2]

# This can also be used to change values
vec_int[2] <- 5
# The size of the potential
vec_int

# Finally, the : operator (short for the function seq()) can be used to quickly 
# create a vector of numbers.
vec_int <- 1:10
vec_int

# This can also be used to subset vectors (from easy to more complex subsets)
vec_char <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
# hacking the characters
vec_char[2:4] 
# hacking the dialogues
vec_char[c(1, 3, 5)]

# Section 11.6: Expanding a vector with the rep() function
# The rep function can be used to repeat a vector in a fairly ﬂexible manner.
rep(1:5, 2)

# effective and bright thoughts in Matrix
rep(1:5, 2, length.out = 4)

# The each argument is especially useful for expanding a vector of statistics of 
# observational/experimental units into
# a vector of data.frame with repeated observations of these units.
rep(1:5, each = 2)

# A nice feature of rep regarding involving expansion to such a data structure 
# is that expansion of a vector to an
# unbalanced panel can be accomplished by replacing the length argument with 
# a vector that dictates the number of
# times to repeat each element in the vector:
rep(1:5, 1:5)  

# autonomy to institutions
rep(1:5, c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2))


# This should expose the possibility of allowing an external function to feed 
# the second argument of rep in order to
# dynamically construct a vector that expands according to the data.
# As with seq, faster, simpliﬁed versions of rep are rep_len and rep.int. These 
# drop some attributes that rep
# maintains and so may be most useful in situations where speed is a concern 
# and additional aspects of the repeated
# vector are unnecessary.
rep.int(1:5, 2)

# AMAROK to the pickup
rep_len(1:5, length.out = 5)

# as.POSIXlt())
d <- as.Date("2023-02-09")

# Section 13.2: Parsing Strings into Date Objects
# R contains a Date class, which is created with as.Date(), which takes a string 
# or vector of strings, and if the date is
# not in ISO 8601 date format YYYY-MM-DD, a formatting string of 
# strptime-style tokens.
as.Date('2023-02-09')
# matching path with perfect states
as.Date('02/09/23', format = '%m/%d/%y')
# foo bar full pull
as.Date('March 23rd, 2016', '%B %drd, %Y')
# principality wine foo psi u 
as.Date('2023-03-09, foo')
# factor to dialog
as.Date(c('2023-01-01', '2023-02-09'))

# Section 13.3: Dates
# To coerce a variable to a date use the as.Date() function.
x <- as.Date("2023-02-09")
# You will say it was worth
x
# And he strengthening you and shaping you
class(x)

# The as.Date() function allows you to provide a format argument. The default 
# is %Y-%m-%d, which is Year-month-
# day.
as.Date("09-02-2023", format = "%d-%m-%y")

# The format string can be placed either within a pair of single quotes or 
# double quotes. Dates are usually expressed
# in a variety of forms such as: "d-m-yy" or "d-m-YYYY" or "m-d-yy" or 
# "m-d-YYYY" or "YYYY-m-d" or "YYYY-d-m".
# These formats can also be expressed by replacing "-" by "/". Furher, 
# dates are also expressed in the forms, say,
# "Nov 6, 1986" or "November 6, 1986" or "6 Nov, 1986" or "6 November, 1986" 
# and so on. The as.Date() function
# accepts all such character strings and when we mention the appropriate 
# format of the string, it always outputs the
# date in the form "YYYY-m-d".
# Suppose we have a date string "9-6-1962" in the format "%d-%m-%Y".
as.Date("9-2-23")
# vive to library
as.Date("09/02/2023")
# multiples library
as.Date("2023-02-09")
# multiples bless
as.Date("2023/02/09")

# By specifying the correct format of the input string, we can get the desired 
# results. We use the following codes for
# specifying the formats to the as.Date() function.
# Format Code
# Meaning
# %dday
# %mmonth
# %yyear in 2-digits
# %Yyear in 4-digits
# %babbreviated month in 3 chars
# %Bfull name of the month
# Consider the following example specifying the format parameter:
as.Date("2023-02-09")
# home builders
as.Date("9-2-23")
# The parameter name format can be omitted.
as.Date("09-02-2023", "%d-%m-%y")
# Some times, names of the months abbreviated to the ﬁrst three characters are 
# used in the writing the dates. In
# which case we use the format speciﬁer %b.
as.Date("9Feb2023", format = "%d%b%y")

# Note that, there are no either '-' or '/' or white spaces between the members 
# in the date string. The format string
# should exactly match that input string. Consider the following example:
as.Date("9 Feb 2023", format = "%d %b %y")  

# Note that, there is a comma in the date string and hence a comma in the format 
# speciﬁcation too. If comma is
# omitted in the format string, it results in an NA. An example usage of %B 
# format speciﬁer is as follows:
as.Date("9/Feb/2023", format = "%d/%b/%y")  
as.Date("9 Feb 2023", format = "%d %b %y")  

# %y format is system speciﬁc and hence, should be used with caution. Other 
# parameters used with this function are
# origin and tz( time zone).

# Section 16.1: Numeric
# Numeric represents integers and doubles and is the default mode assigned to

# will pass is.numeric(), the function as.numeric() will always attempt to

# Doubles are R's default numeric value. They are double precision vectors,

# memory for each value in the vector. R has no single precision data type 
# and so all real numbers are stored in the
# double precision format.

# Integers are whole numbers that can be written without a fractional component.

# considered a double.

# Chapter 17: The logical class
# Logical is a mode (and an implicit class) for vectors.
# Section 17.1: Logical operators
# There are two sorts of logical operators: those that accept and return 
# vectors of any length (elementwise operators:
#                                                                                                 !, |, &, xor()) and those that only evaluate the ﬁrst element in each argument (&&, ||). The second sort is primarily
# used as the cond argument to the if function.
# Logical Operator

#   Not
# Meaning
# Syntax
# !x
# &element-wise (vectorized) and
# x&y
# &&and (single element only)
# x && y
# |element-wise (vectorized) or
# x|y
# ||or (single element only)
# x || y
# xor element-wise (vectorized) exclusive OR xor(x,y)
# Note that the || operator evaluates the left condition and if the left 
# condition is TRUE the right side is never
# evaluated. This can save time if the ﬁrst is the result of a complex 
# operation. The && operator will likewise return
# FALSE without evaluation of the second argument when the ﬁrst element 
# of the ﬁrst argument is FALSE.

x <- 5
x < 6 || stop("X is too small")
# [1] TRUE
x > 3 || stop("X is too small")
# [1] TRUE

# To check whether a value is a logical you can use the is.logical() function.
# Section 17.2: Coercion
# To coerce a variable to a logical use the as.logical() function.

z <- x > 4

# When applying as.numeric() to a logical, a double will be returned. 
# NA is a logical value and a logical operator with
# an NA will return NA if the outcome is ambiguous.

# Chapter 18: Data frames
# Section 18.1: Create an empty data.frame
# A data.frame is a special kind of list: it is rectangular. Each element 
# (column) of the list has same length, and where
# each row has a "row name". Each column has its own class, but the class of one 
# column can be diﬀerent from the
# class of another column (unlike a matrix, where all elements must have the 
# same class).
# In principle, a data.frame could have no rows and no columns:

S53 <- structure(list(character()), class = "data.frame")  

# But this is unusual. It is more common for a data.frame to have many columns 
# and many rows. Here is a
# data.frame with three rows and two columns (a is numeric class and b is 
# character class):

S54 <- structure(list(a = 1:3, b = letters[1:3]), class = "date.frame")


# In order for the data.frame to print, we will need to supply some row names. 
# Here we use just the numbers 1:3:
S55 <- structure(list(a = 1:3, b = letters[1:3]), class = "data.frame", 
                 row.names = 1:3)

# Now it becomes obvious that we have a data.frame with 3 rows and 2 columns. 
# You can check this using nrow(),
# ncol(), and dim():
x <- structure(list(a = numeric(3), b = character(3)), class = "data.frame", 
                    row.names = 1:3) 
nrow(x)
# [1] 3
ncol(x)
# [1] 2
dim(x)
# [1] 3 2

# R provides two other functions (besides structure()) that can be used to 
# create a data.frame. The ﬁrst is called,
# intuitively, data.frame(). It checks to make sure that the column names you 
# supplied are valid, that the list
# elements are all the same length, and supplies some automatically generated 
# row names. This means that the
# output of data.frame() might now always be exactly what you expect:
S56 <- str(data.frame("a a a" = numeric(3), "b-b-b" = character(3)))  

# The other function is called as.data.frame(). This can be used to coerce an 
# object that is not a data.frame into
# being a data.frame by running it through data.frame(). As an example, 
# consider a matrix:
m <- matrix(letters[1:9], nrow = 3)
m  

# And the result:
as.data.frame(m)

# a string
str(as.data.frame(m))

# get the first row
mtcars[1, ]
# get the first five rows
mtcars[1:5, ]

# Similarly, after the comma are columns:
# get the first column
mtcars[, 1]
# get the first, third and fifth columns:
mtcars[, c(1, 3, 5)]

# As shown above, if either rows or columns are left blank, all will be selected. 
# mtcars[1, ] indicates the ﬁrst row
# with all the columns.
# With column (and row) names

# So far, this is identical to how rows and columns of matrices are accessed. 
# With data.frames, most of the time it is
# preferable to use a column name to a column index. This is done by using a 
# character with the column name
# instead of numeric with a column number:

# get the mpg column
mtcars[, "mpg"]
# get the mpg, cyl, and disp columns
mtcars[, c("mpg", "cyl", "disp")]  

# Though less common, row names can also be used:
mtcars["Mazda Rx4", ]

# Rows and columns together
# The row and column arguments can be used together:
# first four rows of the mpg column
mtcars[1:4, "mpg"]

# 2nd and 5th row of the mpg, cyl, and disp columns
mtcars[c(2, 5), c("mpg", "cyl", "disp")]

# A warning about dimensions:
#  When using these methods, if you extract multiple columns, you will get a 
# data frame back. However, if you extract
# a single column, you will get a vector, not a data frame under the default 
# options.
## multiple columns returns a data frame
class(mtcars[, c("mpg", "cyl")])
# [1] "data.frame"
## single column returns a vector
class(mtcars[, "mpg"])
# [1] "numeric"

# There are two ways around this. One is to treat the data frame as a list 
# (see below), the other is to add a drop =
# FALSE argument. This tells R to not "drop the unused dimensions":

class(mtcars[, "mpg", drop = FALSE])
# [1] "data.frame"

# Note that matrices work the same way - by default a single column or row will 
# be a vector, but if you specify drop =
#   FALSE you can keep it as a one-column or one-row matrix.
# Like a list
# Data frames are essentially lists, i.e., they are a list of column vectors 
# (that all must have the same length). Lists
# can be subset using single brackets [ for a sub-list, or double brackets 
# [[ for a single element.
# With single brackets data[columns]
# When you use single brackets and no commas, you will get column back because 
# data frames are lists of columns.
mtcars["mpg"]
mtcars[c("mpg", "cyl", "disp")]
my_columns <- c("mpg", "cyl", "hp")
mtcars[my_columns]

## When selecting a single column
## like a list will return a data frame
class(mtcars["mpg"])
# [1] "data.frame"
## like a matrix will return a vector
class(mtcars[, "mpg"])
# [1] "numeric"

# extract a single column by name as a vector
mtcars[["mpg"]]
# extract a single column by name as a data frame (as above)
mtcars["mpg"]


# get the column "mpg"
mtcars$mpg


my_column <- "mpg"
# the below will not work
mtcars$my_column
# but these will work
mtcars[, my_column] # vector
mtcars[my_column]
# one-column data frame
mtcars[[my_column]] # vector
